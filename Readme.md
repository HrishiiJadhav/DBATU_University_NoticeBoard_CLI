Install the required modules first.
	- pip install -r requirements.txt


Welcome to this project.
	If you are viewing this project you are probably a BATU University student like me. 
As of me I was always forgetting to check universities site for updates, So I created this script to help me out.
With help of this script we can get updated in a single command and save some time which is very convinient for me.

Few suggestions:

	- You can add symlink in path in linux and run script from anywhere in terminal.
	- If you're on Linux distro you can automate this script to run every week or so.


THANK YOU!
